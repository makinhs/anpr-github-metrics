# GitMeMetrics

This prototype was created for Hack.Developers at 07/08 October in the Camerino Campus at Italy.


## Colaborators
This current prototype were made with the following team
- [Marcos Henrique da Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-silva-6277b266/): full-stack role
- [Silvia Federici](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvia-federici-8957485b/): Designer/UX role

## Quick Overview

- Back-end have a good skeleton to keep the working with it.
- Front-end is just a scretch that was aimed to use Ionic 2 but we didn't get time to work with it.
- The designer/ux from our team, Silvia, made an awesome wireframe that someone need to integrate within the front-end.

## Prototype Overview

- This prototype was aimed to be generic to all public github projects. Is is splited from back-end and front-end.
- We aimed to extract some github informations and save in a database to parse huge data later on.
- Back-end doesn't parse all the information but it has all what you need to start handle data.



## Back-end
 
 The back-end was made with node.js (6), using mysql to save some data on it.
 - We use Express to expose the API
 - MySQL script can be found at the root docs folder
 - The project is at the back-end folder
 - It has several modules that allows a good maintenance of code.
 - Has facebook login ready to use
 - Can start the project running at back-end folder the following: `node index.js`
Make sure to have the latest `node` and `npm` installed on your local machine. 
To run the application, just run the following command:
- `npm start`
    - It will run the application by the default port: 3500.


## Front-end

It uses a scratch from Ionic 2, not integrated with the back-end yet and only the pages to switch from one to another without any information. We, unfortunately, didn't got time to work with it.

### Front-end desired wireframes

Here are the following desired wireframes made by Silvia ;) 

You can also check the docs folder with the wireframes.
